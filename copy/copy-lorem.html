<h1>Lorem Ipsum</h1>
<p>

  In publishing and graphic design, <em>lorem ipsum</em> is a placeholder text
  (filler text) commonly used to demonstrate the graphic elements of a document
  or visual presentation, such as font, typography, and layout, by removing the
  distraction of meaningful content. The lorem ipsum text is typically a section
  of a Latin text by Cicero with words altered, added, and removed that make it
  nonsensical and not proper Latin.

  A variation of the common lorem ipsum text has been used since the 1960s or
  earlier to provide a filler text during typesetting. The text is derived from
  sections 1.10.32â€“3 of Cicero's <em>De finibus bonorum et malorum</em> (On the
  Boundaries of Goods and Evils, or alternatively [About] The Purposes of Good
  and Evil). The original passage began: Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem
  ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit (translation:
  &ldquo;Neither is there anyone who loves pain itself since it is pain and thus
  wants to obtain it&rdquo;). It is not known exactly when the text acquired its
  current standard form; it may have been as late as the 1960s. Richard
  McClintock, a Latin scholar who was the publications director at Hampden-
  Sydney College in Virginia, discovered the source of the passage sometime
  before 1982 while searching for citings of the Latin word
  &ldquo;consectetur&rdquo;, rarely used in classical literature. The physical
  source of the Lorem Ipsum text may be the 1914 Loeb Classical Library Edition
  of the De Finibus, where the Latin text finishes page 34 with &ldquo;Neque
  porro quisquam est qui do-" and begins page 36 with &ldquo;lorem ipsum (et
  seq.)&hellip;", suggesting that the galley type of that page was scrambled to
  make the dummy text seen today. This suggests that &ldquo;lorem ipsum&rdquo;
  may have been used as dummy text before the Letraset transfer sheets
  popularized it.

  A common form of lorem ipsum text reads as follows:

</p><p>

  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
  tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
  quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo
  consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse
  cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non
  proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
