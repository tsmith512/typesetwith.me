<h1>Leading</h1>
<p>
  A term originating from hand-typesetting, <em>leading</em> (pronounced
  &ldquo;LEDD-ing&rdquo;) refers to the width of thin strips of lead placed
  between lines of type increase the spacing between them. In modern digital
  typography, the term more frequently refers to the distance from the baseline
  of one line of text to the baseline of the next (and therefore includes both
  the height of the line plus the height of the lead) and is frequently called
  the &ldquo;line height&rdquo; in consumer-oriented word processors.

<p>
  Text set &ldquo;solid&rdquo; (no leading) appears cramped, makes it difficult
  for the eye to track from the end of one line to the beginning of the next,
  and makes vertical rivers between words more obvious than the spacing between
  lines. However, when leading is too high, lines can also be difficult to
  track visually, and vertical space is wasted.

  For body copy paragraphs, half of the height of the type is a decent starting
  place to determine good leading (for a total height 1.5 times the size of the
  type). This must be adjusted based on the typeface, type size, measure,
  contrast between the type and the background, and the intended audience.

  <em>Please note:</em> the leading of samples in this application <em>does</em>
  include the total line height. The color-coding of the leading is based on the
  ratio of the true leading (just the interline space) and the type size.
