<h1>Leading</h1>
<p>
  A term originating from hand-typesetting, <em>leading</em> (pronounced
  (&ldquo;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;font-size:1.175em;line-height:1;">ledd</span>-ing&rdquo;)
  refers to the width of thin strips of lead placed between lines of type to
  increase the spacing between them. In modern digital typography, the term
  usually refers to the distance from one baseline to the next (and therefore
  includes both the height of the text plus the spacing between lines) and is
  frequently called the &ldquo;line height&rdquo; in consumer-oriented word
  processors.

<p>
  Text set &ldquo;solid&rdquo; (no leading) appears cramped, making it difficult
  for the eye to track from the end of one line to the beginning of the next,
  and making vertical rivers between words more obvious than the spacing between
  lines. However, when leading is too wide, lines can also be difficult to
  track visually, and vertical space is wasted.

  For body copy, a decent <em>starting</em> place for leading is &frac14; to
  &frac12; the height of the type, for a total
  <a class="definition" href="javascript:loadSample('definition-lineheight.html')">line height</a>
  of 1.25 to 1.5. This must be adjusted based on the
  <a class="definition" href="javascript:loadSample('definition-typeface.html')">typeface</a>,
  <a class="definition" href="javascript:loadSample('definition-size.html')">type size</a>,
  <a class="definition" href="javascript:loadSample('definition-measure.html')">measure</a>,
  contrast (difference in <a href="javascript:loadSample('definition-color.html');">color</a>)
  between the type and the background, and the intended audience.

  <em>Please note:</em> the leading of samples in this application <em>does</em>
  include the total line height. The color-coding of the leading is based on the
  ratio of the interline space and the type size.
