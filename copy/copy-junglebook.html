<h1>The Jungle Book</h1>
<h2>Kaa&rsquo;s Hunting</h2>
<p>
  All that is told here happened some time before Mowgli was turned out of the
  Seeonee Wolf Pack, or revenged himself on Shere Khan the tiger. It was in the
  days when Baloo was teaching him the Law of the Jungle. The big, serious, old
  brown bear was delighted to have so quick a pupil, for the young wolves will
  only learn as much of the Law of the Jungle as applies to their own pack and
  tribe, and run away as soon as they can repeat the Hunting
  Verse&mdash;&ldquo;Feet that make no noise; eyes that can see in the dark;
  ears that can hear the winds in their lairs, and sharp white teeth, all these
  things are the marks of our brothers except Tabaqui the Jackal and the Hyaena
  whom we hate.&rdquo; But Mowgli, as a man-cub, had to learn a great deal more
  than this. Sometimes Bagheera the Black Panther would come lounging through
  the jungle to see how his pet was getting on, and would purr with his head
  against a tree while Mowgli recited the day&rsquo;s lesson to Baloo. The boy
  could climb almost as well as he could swim, and swim almost as well as he
  could run. So Baloo, the Teacher of the Law, taught him the Wood and Water
  Laws: how to tell a rotten branch from a sound one; how to speak politely to
  the wild bees when he came upon a hive of them fifty feet above ground; what
  to say to Mang the Bat when he disturbed him in the branches at midday; and
  how to warn the water-snakes in the pools before he splashed down among them.
  None of the Jungle People like being disturbed, and all are very ready to fly
  at an intruder. Then, too, Mowgli was taught the Strangers' Hunting Call,
  which must be repeated aloud till it is answered, whenever one of the Jungle-
  People hunts outside his own grounds. It means, translated, &ldquo;Give me
  leave to hunt here because I am hungry.&rdquo; And the answer is, &ldquo;Hunt
  then for food, but not for pleasure.&rdquo;
