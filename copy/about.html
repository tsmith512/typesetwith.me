<h1>About Typesetwith.me</h1>
<h2>Howdy</h2>
<p>
  My name is <a href="http://www.tsmithcreative.com">Taylor Smith</a>. I'm a web
  developer and graphic designer, and I love typography. I also like teaching
  others about typography, especially clients who want to learn more about
  how much care goes into the production of their pieces by creative
  professionals.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>
  I absolutely love (and have referred many clients to) <em>Tommi Kaikkonen's
  <a href="http://kaikkonendesign.fi/typography/">Interactive Guide to Blog
  Typography</a></em>. However, I saw a few opportunities to take it a bit
  further by allowing visitors to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>See how these metrics interact with each other</li>
  <li>Practice reading different samples in custom typesettings.</li>
</ul>
