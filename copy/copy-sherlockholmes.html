<h2>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2>
<h3>A Scandal in Bohemia</h3>
<p>
  Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the
  principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the
  window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I
  could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized
  with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I
  never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the
  beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness
  with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest
  treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to
  me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After
  all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from
  injuring another.

  Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in
  need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same
  instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the
  room with a cry of &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; The word was no sooner out of my mouth
  than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill&mdash;lgentlemen,
  ostlers, and servant maids&mdash;joined in a general shriek of
  &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at
  the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the
  voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping
  through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in
  ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend&rsquo;s arm in mine, and to get
  away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few
  minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards
  the Edgeware Road.
