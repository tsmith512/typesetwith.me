<h1>Contrast</h1>
<p>
  Both in print and on-screen, using a softer alternative to white or black text
  can ease the strain of reading long passages. Additionally, when combining
  slightly grey text with stronger black headers, the visual hierarchy of the
  composition is strengthened.
</p>
<p>
  On the flip side, it's important to retain sufficient contrast for
  accessibility, particularly if your project must meet certain guidelines.
  In this example, the slider turns orange when the text no longer meets
  WCAG AAA contrast guidelines, and red when the text no longer meets
  WCAG AA guidelines*. Learn more and test your own color combinations at

<blockquote>
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">WCAG 2.0</a> level AA requires a
  contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1
  for large text. Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of 7:1 for normal text and
  4.5:1 for large text. Large text is defined as 14 point (typically 18.66px)
  and bold or larger, or 18 point (typically 24px) or larger.
