<h1>Frankenstein, or the Modern&nbsp;Prometheus</h1>
<h2>Chapter 11</h2>
<p>
  It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the original era of my
  being; all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct. A strange
  multiplicity of sensations seized me, and I saw, felt, heard, and smelt at the
  same time; and it was, indeed, a long time before I learned to distinguish
  between the operations of my various senses. By degrees, I remember, a
  stronger light pressed upon my nerves, so that I was obliged to shut my eyes.
  Darkness then came over me and troubled me, but hardly had I felt this when,
  by opening my eyes, as I now suppose, the light poured in upon me again. I
  walked and, I believe, descended, but I presently found a great alteration in
  my sensations. Before, dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me, impervious to
  my touch or sight; but I now found that I could wander on at liberty, with no
  obstacles which I could not either surmount or avoid. The light became more
  and more oppressive to me, and the heat wearying me as I walked, I sought a
  place where I could receive shade. This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and
  here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue, until I felt
  tormented by hunger and thirst. This roused me from my nearly dormant state,
  and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the
  ground. I slaked my thirst at the brook, and then lying down, was overcome by
  sleep.
