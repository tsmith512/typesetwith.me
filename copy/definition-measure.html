<h1>Measure</h1>
<p>
  The Measure is the length of a line of text, measured in average characters per
  line. For a single-column design, the measure should ideally lie
  between 40 &amp; 80 characters. Many typographers consider the perfect measure
  to be 65 characters. If the lines are too short, the text becomes
  disjointed. If lines are too long, the content loses rhythm as the reader
  searches for the start of each line. This is effect is amplified with improper
  <a class="definition" href="javascript:loadSample('definition-leading.html')">leading</a>.
  Generally, if the measure is wide, the leading of a text
  should be increased&mdash;if the measure is short, it can be decreased more safely.

  approximated by diving the total number of characters by .5 minus the number
  of lines in the first paragraph of the sample.
