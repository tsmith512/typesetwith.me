<h1>Measure</h1>
<p>
  Measure (or sometimes &ldquo;The Measure&rdquo;) in typography is the length
  of a line of text. For a single-column design measure should ideally lie
  between 40 &amp; 80 characters. Many typographers consider the perfect measure
  to be 65 characters. If the lines are too short then the text becomes
  disjointed, if they are too long the content loses rhythm as the reader
  searches for the start of each line. Punctuation should preferably hang
  outside the measure. Generally, if the measure is wide, the leading of a text
  should be increasedâ€”if the measure is short, it is can safely be decreased.
  In print, reverse text (white text on black) also requires more leading.
