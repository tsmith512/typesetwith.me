<h1>The Adventures of Huckleberry&nbsp;Finn</h1>
<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<p>
  We spread the blankets inside for a carpet, and eat our dinner in there. We
  put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern. Pretty soon it
  darkened up, and begun to thunder and lighten; so the birds was right about
  it. Directly it begun to rain, and it rained like all fury, too, and I never
  see the wind blow so. It was one of these regular summer storms. It would get
  so dark that it looked all blue-black outside, and lovely; and the rain would
  thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and
  spider-webby; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees
  down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves; and then a perfect ripper
  of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if
  they was just wild; and next, when it was just about the bluest and
  blackest&mdash;<em>FST!</em> it was as bright as glory, and you'd have a
  little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm,
  hundreds of yards further than you could see before; dark as sin again in a
  second, and now you'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash, and then go
  rumbling, grumbling, tumbling, down the sky towards the under side of the
  world, like rolling empty barrels down stairs&mdash;where it's long stairs and
  they bounce a good deal, you know.
