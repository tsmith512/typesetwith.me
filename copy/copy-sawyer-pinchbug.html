<h1>The Adventures of Tom Sawyer</h1>
<h2>Chapter 5 (Excerpt)</h2>

  Now he lapsed into suffering again, as the dry argument was resumed. Presently
  he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It was a large black
  beetle with formidable jawsâ€”a "pinchbug," he called it. It was in a
  percussion-cap box. The first thing the beetle did was to take him by the
  finger. A natural fillip followed, the beetle went floundering into the aisle
  and lit on its back, and the hurt finger went into the boy's mouth. The beetle
  lay there working its helpless legs, unable to turn over. Tom eyed it, and
  longed for it; but it was safe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in
  the sermon found relief in the beetle, and they eyed it too. Presently a
  vagrant poodle dog came idling along, sad at heart, lazy with the summer
  softness and the quiet, weary of captivity, sighing for change. He spied the
  beetle; the drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize; walked
  around it; smelt at it from a safe distance; walked around it again; grew
  bolder, and took a closer smell; then lifted his lip and made a gingerly
  snatch at it, just missing it; made another, and another; began to enjoy the
  diversion; subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws, and
  continued his experiments; grew weary at last, and then indifferent and
  absent-minded. His head nodded, and little by little his chin descended and
  touched the enemy, who seized it. There was a sharp yelp, a flirt of the
  poodle's head, and the beetle fell a couple of yards away, and lit on its back
  once more. The neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy, several
  faces went behind fans and hand-kerchiefs, and Tom was entirely happy. The dog
  looked foolish, and probably felt so; but there was resentment in his heart,
  too, and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began a wary
  attack on it again; jumping at it from every point of a circle, lighting with
  his fore-paws within an inch of the creature, making even closer snatches at
  it with his teeth, and jerking his head till his ears flapped again. But he
  grew tired once more, after a while; tried to amuse himself with a fly but
  found no relief; followed an ant around, with his nose close to the floor, and
  quickly wearied of that; yawned, sighed, forgot the beetle entirely, and sat
  down on it. Then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up
  the aisle; the yelps continued, and so did the dog; he crossed the house in
  front of the altar; he flew down the other aisle; he crossed before the doors;
  he clamored up the home-stretch; his anguish grew with his progress, till
  presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the
  speed of light. At last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course, and
  sprang into its master's lap; he flung it out of the window, and the voice of
  distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance.

  By this time the whole church was red-faced and suffocating with suppressed
  laughter, and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. The discourse was
  resumed presently, but it went lame and halting, all possibility of
  impressiveness being at an end; for even the gravest sentiments were
  constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth, under cover
  of some remote pew-back, as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious
  thing. It was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was
  over and the benediction pronounced.

  Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful, thinking to himself that there was some
  satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it. He
  had but one marring thought; he was willing that the dog should play with his
  pinchbug, but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off.
