<h1>Treasure Island</h1>
<h2>Part One, Chapter One</h2>
<p>
  At first I had supposed &ldquo;the dead man's chest&rdquo; to be that
  identical big box of his upstairs in the front room, and the thought had been
  mingled in my nightmares with that of the one-legged seafaring man. But by
  this time we had all long ceased to pay any particular notice to the song; it
  was new, that night, to nobody but Dr. Livesey, and on him I observed it did
  not produce an agreeable effect, for he looked up for a moment quite angrily
  before he went on with his talk to old Taylor, the gardener, on a new cure for
  the rheumatics. In the meantime, the captain gradually brightened up at his
  own music, and at last flapped his hand upon the table before him in a way we
  all knew to mean silence. The voices stopped at once, all but Dr. Livesey's;
  he went on as before speaking clear and kind and drawing briskly at his pipe
  between every word or two. The captain glared at him for a while, flapped his
  hand again, glared still harder, and at last broke out with a villainous, low
  oath, &ldquo;Silence, there, between decks!&rdquo;
</p><p>
  &ldquo;Were you addressing me, sir?&rdquo; says the doctor; and when the
  ruffian had told him, with another oath, that this was so, &ldquo;I have only
  one thing to say to you, sir,&rdquo; replies the doctor, &ldquo;that if you
  keep on drinking rum, the world will soon be quit of a very dirty
  scoundrel!&rdquo;
</p><p>
  The old fellow's fury was awful. He sprang to his feet, drew and opened a
  sailor's clasp-knife, and balancing it open on the palm of his hand,
  threatened to pin the doctor to the wall.
</p><p>
  The doctor never so much as moved. He spoke to him as before, over his
  shoulder and in the same tone of voice, rather high, so that all the room
  might hear, but perfectly calm and steady: &ldquo;If you do not put that knife
  this instant in your pocket, I promise, upon my honour, you shall hang at the
  next assizes.&rdquo;
