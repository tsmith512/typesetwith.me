<h1>Line Height</h1>
<p>
  The height of a line of text, measured from the baseline of one line to the
  baseline of the next. Line height may be specified as a multiple of the type
  size (as it is here), or using an actual measurement like points or pixels
  (frequently called
  <a class="definition" href="javascript:loadSample('definition-leading.html')">leading</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Text with no spacing between lines appears cramped, making it difficult for the
  eye to track from the end of one line to the beginning of the next, and making
  vertical rivers between words more obvious than the spacing between lines.
  However, when the line height leaves too much space between text, lines can
  also be difficult to track visually, and vertical space is wasted.
