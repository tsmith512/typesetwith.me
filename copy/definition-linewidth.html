<h1>Line Width</h1>
<p>
  The width of the text container affects the number of characters which can be
  placed in a single line of text: the
  <a href="javascript:loadSample('definition-measure.html')">measure</a>.
  On mobile devices, the container is freqnently limited by the width of the
  device, but a maximum width should be set to maintain legibility on wider
  screens. For a single-column design measure should ideally lie between forty
  and eighty characters.
